        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <!--use <blockquote> to quote something that was a paragraph or more, can put <q> inside <blockquote> but not oppsite

            <br>

    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    </p>
    <p>
        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>cellphone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <!--<q> element, the browser knows that some of that text is a real quote,can display it in the best way possible-->
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
