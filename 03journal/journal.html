    <p>
      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way

      <!--Thereâ€™s a linebreak before the list starts, so <ol> must be a block element, so is <li>-->

    <p>
      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today: 
    </p>
    <!--use <blockquote> to quote something that was a paragraph or more, can put <q> inside <blockquote> but not oppsite

      <blockquote>
      <!--<br> empty element half-->
        Passing cars, <br>

        May get you, <br>
        A glimpse, Of eternity. <br>
      </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing 
      any cars.

      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:  
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>cellphone</li> 
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
      </ul> 
    <p>
      Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, 
      <!--<q> element, the browser knows that some of that text is a real quote,can display it in the best way possible-->
      <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway.</q>
