    <h1>Welcome to myPod</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, wherever you might be. Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod, from the early classic iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle to the largest iPod Photo, and a digital camera. Just take a snapshot of your iPod in your favorite location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod. So, what are you waiting for?

    <h2>Seattle, Washington</h2>

    1.You could use the width and height attributes to resize an image, but that’s not a good idea. Because if you do that, you’re still downloading the full-size image, and making the browser do the work to resize the image 
    The width and height attributes are really there to help the browser figure out how much space to reserve for the image; if you use them, they should match the actual width and height of the image.
