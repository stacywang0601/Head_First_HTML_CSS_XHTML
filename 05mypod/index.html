    <h1>Welcome to myPod</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, wherever you might be. Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod, from the early classic iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle to the largest iPod Photo, and a digital camera. Just take a snapshot of your iPod in your favorite location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod. So, what are you waiting for?

    <h2>Seattle, Washington</h2>
    <p>
        Me and my iPod in Seattle! You can see rain clouds and the Space Needle. You can't see the 628 coffee shops.

    1.You could use the width and height attributes to resize an image, but that’s not a good idea. Because if you do that, you’re still downloading the full-size image, and making the browser do the work to resize the image 
    The width and height attributes are really there to help the browser figure out how much space to reserve for the image; if you use them, they should match the actual width and height of the image.
    2.alt : If the image can’t be displayed, then this text is used in its place.
    3. the <img> element is an inline element.So, if there are several images together in your HTML, the
    browser will fit them side by side if the browser window is wide enough.
    4. make links out of images, add <a>-->

    <h2>Birmingham, England</h2>
    <p>
        Here are some iPod photos around Birmingham. We’ve obviously got some passionate folks over here who love their iPods. Check out the classic red British telephone box!

        <!-- you could link directly to the image, like this: <a href=“photos/seattle_downtown.jpg”> ... </a>. If you did that and clicked on the link, the browser would display the image by itself on a blank page. In general though, linking directly to an image is considered bad form, because you usually want to provide some context for the images you are displaying.-->
